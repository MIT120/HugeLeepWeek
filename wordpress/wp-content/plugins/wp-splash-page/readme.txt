Add a fully customizable splash page for your WordPress site, it's simple and easy to use.

== Description ==

**WARNING!**: If you have custom templates, please make a backup before update the plugin.

WP Splash Page is a useful plugin if you wish a splash page in your WordPress site. In a easy way you can set up the plugin by choosing the text color or the background image among other things. It also provides you with some important features like age validation.
Bots can't see the splash page. Instead, they go directly to the original page. By this way you won't lose ranking and visibility in search engines.

**This isn't a plugin for Maintenance Mode or Coming Soon!**

* Without loss of indexing in search engines
* Keep running even if the cookies or javascript is disabled. Nerds can't avoid it ;)
* Fully customizable
* Choose days until it shown again
* Template system. Create your own style
* Age verification
* Checkbox opt-in, for Disclaimers, Agreements, Terms of Use, etc.
